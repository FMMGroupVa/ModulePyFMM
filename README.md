> *PyFMM: A Python module for Frequency-Modulated MÃ¶bius Signal Decomposition*  
> Christian Canedo, RocÃ­o CarratalÃ¡-SÃ¡ez, Cristina Rueda
> [Submitted, 2025]

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the PyFMM Python package, which implements the Frequency-Modulated MÃ¶bius (FMM) model for signal decomposition. The package includes tools for model fitting, parameter constraints, component analysis, and applications in biomedical and spectrographic data.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fast and modular implementation of the FMM model
- Support for constrained parameter estimation
- Integration with AFD-based initializations
- Tools for multichannel signal decomposition
- Built-in diagnostics and visualization
